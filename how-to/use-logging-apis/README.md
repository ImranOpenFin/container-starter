# How to use logging APIs

## How it Works

1. A drop down of OpenFin Runtime Debug logs is presented to via the project interface to show the log files retrieved by the get log list API.
2. A send app log button that invokes the sendApplicationLog API.

## Get Started

Follow the instructions below to get up and running.

### Set up the project

1. Install dependencies and do the initial build. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```shell
npm run setup
```

2. Build the project.

```shell
npm run build
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```shell
npm run start
```

4. Start the Platform application.

```shell
npm run client
```
